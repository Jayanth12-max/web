      Hey Jaanu, you might have got many love letters but ig this will be different from othersâ€¦
Sometimes life surprises us in the most beautiful ways and you are the most unexpected and beautiful surprise Iâ€™ve ever received.
I still remember the 23rd of August 2024 so clearly the day we met. It seemed like just another day, but little did I know it would become one of the most meaningful days of my life. From that moment on, something quietly changed in me. But even then, I never imagined that one day, I would get to call you mine.
Honestly, I never thought Iâ€™d be in a relationship with you. But then you looked into my eyes and confessed your feelings and in that moment, time stopped. It felt surreal, like a scene out of a dream I never dared to have. Your words didnâ€™t just touch my ears, they reached my heart, gently but deeply. And I knew, from that instant, that everything had changed.
You turned the ordinary into something magical. You made me feel seen, understood, and genuinely cared for in a way no one else ever has. Being with you feels like peace and excitement all at once like finally finding a place I belong.
Chotee thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your love. You made a dream come true the day you chose me. And every day since then, youâ€™ve continued to make life more beautiful just by being in it.
No matter where life takes us, Iâ€™ll always treasure you and that unforgettable moment when a dream walked into my reality and smiled at me.
You mean a lot to me I just wanna tell you that I love you soo much<3
